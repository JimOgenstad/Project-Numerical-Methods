# Project-Numerical-Methods
## About The Project
This is a laboratory project for an introductory course in numerical methods at KTH

The project studies sound waves in an enclosed room. First, mathematical equations for the sound waves in the room are derived, and then two optimization problems are solved:

1. Determine the position and strength of a source based on the normal derivatives along the room's walls.
2. Given a sound frequency, place the source so that a specific area in the room experiences minimal sound level.
